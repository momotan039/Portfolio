                As a Full Stack Developer at Works for me, I create an inclusive platform that fosters meaningful
                connections between candidates and employers. I actively participate in designing and implementing
                cutting-edge features on both the front-end and back-end using MongoDB, Node.js, and React. By
                maintaining a user-centric focus and adhering to high-quality standards, I contribute to building a
                brighter and more equitable future for all.

                I graduated from the Bootcamp Full Stack program at Appleseeds in April 2023, where I learned the
                fundamentals of web development and gained hands-on experience with various technologies and tools.
                Prior to that, I obtained a Diploma of Education in Computer Software Engineering from ORT Colleges in
                October 2022, where I developed my programming and problem-solving skills. I am committed to continuous
                learning and growth, and I thrive in collaborative and dynamic environments. My goal is to leverage my
                technical expertise and passion for web development to create impactful and efficient web solutions.
